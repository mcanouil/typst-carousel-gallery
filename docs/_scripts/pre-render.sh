# Documentation Pre-render Script
# Generates the project variables and the changelog page, and caches the social

#
# Both generated files, _variables.yml and changelog.qmd, are ignored by Git and
# removed by post-render.sh.
#
# A repository that publishes a Quarto extension also has _scripts/sync-extension.sh
# beside this script. That copy cannot be made here: Quarto resolves extensions
# before any pre-render script runs, so the sync is a separate step, run before
# the render rather than during it.
#
# assets/social/og-image.png is ignored by Git as well, but it is a cache rather
# than a transient, so post-render.sh leaves it in place. It is GitHub's own
# preview card for this repository, which the endpoint serves for public
# repositories only: for anything else it answers 200 with a generic Octocat
# placeholder rather than an error, so the card is checked as well as fetched.
# A local render and a pull request check both carry on without one; only the
# render that publishes refuses to. See assets/social/README.md.
#
# _variables.yml carries the repository and the version the site documents, so a
# page can name the release it was built from rather than a slug that resolves to
# whatever is on the default branch. Quarto re-reads the project configuration
# after pre-render, which is what makes a generated variables file work at all.
#
# Every site gets a `repository` block. A repository that publishes a Quarto
# extension gets an `extension` block as well, carrying the reference a reader
# installs, so the pages can write `quarto add {{< var extension.reference >}}`.
# The version comes from the extension manifest, which the release workflow
# bumps; without a manifest it comes from the newest version tag, which is what
# the Pages workflow renders from.
#
# Version headings are restructured into a three-level hierarchy:
#
#   ## X.Y.Z (date)          (in CHANGELOG.md)
#
# becomes:
#
#   ## X {#version-X}
#   ### X.Y {#version-X-Y}
#   #### X.Y.Z (date) {#version-X-Y-Z}
#
# A version heading is promoted by two levels, so every heading nested under it
# shifts by the same two: "### New Features" becomes "##### New Features".
# Without the shift a subsection closes the version it belongs to, and the
# document outline stops matching the page.
#
# The "Unreleased" section is omitted, so the page describes released versions
# only.

# The Open Graph card, cached from GitHub's own repository preview. The first
# path segment is a cache key GitHub accepts any value for. Written through a
# temporary file so a failed fetch cannot truncate a good cache.
#
# A card under a day old is left alone. The endpoint rate-limits, and a preview
# session re-runs this script on every full render, so refetching each time
# earns a 429 rather than a fresher card. CI checks out a fresh tree, where
# nothing is cached, so it always fetches.
#
# `--retry` covers that rate limiting: curl counts HTTP 429 as a transient
# error, alongside 408 and the 5xx family, and honours any Retry-After.
